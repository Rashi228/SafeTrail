# 🛡️ Smart Tourist Safety Monitoring & Incident Response System  
**AI-powered safety platform using Geo-Fencing, Blockchain-based Digital Identity, and Real-Time Incident Response**

---

## 📖 Overview
Tourist safety is a critical challenge in crowded or unfamiliar environments. Traditional systems rely heavily on manual reporting and delayed response times.  

This project leverages **AI, Geo-fencing, and Blockchain** to provide a **real-time safety ecosystem** that:  
- Detects incidents (manual SOS + AI-powered fall/scream detection).  
- Monitors tourist movement in high-risk zones using **geo-fencing**.  
- Issues **verifiable digital IDs** via blockchain to enable secure identity validation.  
- Provides a **real-time responder dashboard** for authorities to take action.
